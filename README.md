# Project 1
## Analysis how the law of stop issuing new license for FHV has improved the traffic speed.
### Introduction
- Before COVID, the traffic congestion in NYC has always been a problem. According to the report done by Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) and Department of transportation (DOT), the average speed for a vehicle that travelled in Manhattan core has decreased form 6.1mph in 2010 to 4.3mph in 2018 \cite{NYCReport}. There were many factors influencing traffic in NYC. For example, increasing use of for-hire vehicle, weather, time of day. It is straightforward when understanding the correlation between traffic with time of day and weather. However, it is difficult to understand why the traffic is serious with more hire vehicles made available. In fact, the market has saturated with the introduction of app-based services like Uber, Lyft, Juno, and Via. To cope with this staggering situation, a law was passed in August 2018 to stop issuing any new FHV licenses for a year. It was passed for the purpose of limiting cruising vehicles and increasing efficiency. TLC predicted the law will take effect in August 2019

### Dataset
##### Time period: July and August 2018, 2019
- weather data. Downloaded and derived from internet. url = https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USW00094728/detail 

- traffic speed data. Downloaded and derived from internet. url = https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/DOT-Traffic-Speeds-NBE/i4gi-tjb9/data

- TLC data. Green and yellow taxi

### Languages
- Python

### Repository Structure
##### Preprocessing of traffic data.ipynb
- In this file, I did preprocessing of the traffic data.It is impossible to upload the file to jupyter notebook, so I am doing it on jupyter notebook and upload it to hub. 

##### Preprocess weather dataset.ipynb
- In this file, I did preprocessing of the weather. It is impossible to upload the file to jupyter notebook, so I am doing it on jupyter notebook and upload it to hub. 

##### Project 1 (1).ipynb
- This file include all works, preprocessing of taxi data, visualisation, statistical analysis.

##### html files
- These are the plots generated, but unable to save. They are not able to be presented in the file. So I generated and upload seperately.

##### new_df_weather & new_df_traffic
- These are the two dataset cleaned after preprocessing.

### Packages
- common packages used in tut
